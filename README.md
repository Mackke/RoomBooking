Task: Build a REST API that allows users to search for and book hotel rooms.
The API should be built with reasonable production quality given the limited time.

Requirements:

Use Java and Spring Boot to build the API.
We suggest you use Spring Initializer to set up the project quickly.
Use a database of your choosing for storing the bookings, we suggest H2.

Each hotel room should have a name, description, number of beds, price, and availability information (i.e. dates available).

Implement endpoints:
1) for searching for available rooms; given a date range and number of beds
2) for booking hotel rooms; return a booking reference-ID usable in #4
3) for searching current bookings; given a date range
4) for cancelling current bookings

Write unit tests for each endpoint.

Deliverables:

A zip-file (or git repository) with the code for the project.
